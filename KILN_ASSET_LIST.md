   - For characters: Edit `src/modules/animation.ts` - Create animation clips

2. **Verify in Kiln**
   - Click "Load Asset" in viewer
   - Check triangle count (stay under budget)
   - Test animations (for characters)
   - Verify textures render correctly

3. **Export GLB**
   - Click "Export GLB"
   - File saved as `{assetName}-v{version}-{seed}.glb`

4. **Import to Game**

## 📝 NOTES

- All assets use **PSX aesthetic**: Low-poly, simple textures, no advanced shaders
- **Texture library** in Kiln has 151 textures - use these when possible
- Keep polygon counts LOW for authentic PSX feel
- Characters can use full 50k budget for animations
- Props should stay well under 10k budget (aim for 2k-5k)
- All textures from Kiln are CC0 (free for commercial use)
- Export all assets with deterministic seeds for reproducibility

**Total Asset Count: 70 models + 7 ground textures = 77 production items**
